\subsection{Decentralized Cross-Chain Oracle}\label{subsec:cross-chain-oracle}

In oracle mode of operation the system is capable of providing a notarized set of events \
observed on supported blockchains.
Cross-Chain Oracle is a simple yet solving the cross-chain interoperability solution.

\subsection{Custodial Asset Management}\label{subsec:custodial-asset-management}

In custodial mode of operation the system is capable of managing user assets which are stored on corresponding \
blockchains in \emph{vaults}.
Each vault stores epoch number $n$, an aggregated public key $aPK_n$ of the current validator set $V_n$ and
is guarded with a script (smart-contract) capable of performing verification of
an aggregated signature ${verify: (\sigma_n, m_n, aPK_n) \rightarrow 0 | 1}$.

\paragraph{Natively Cross-Chain Applications}

Decentralized custodial management in conjunction with a computational layer can be highly beneficial for expanding \
the capabilities of the system.
Moving beyond simple bridges to what we call \emph{Natively Cross-Chain Applications} (NCCAs).
NCCAs are applications that are deployed in cross-chain network and are capable of interacting with other blockchains \
without the need of external oracles or bridges.
