This section presents Spectrum protocol design starting from a naive approach based on PBFT and gradually addressing the challenges.

\subsection{Strawman Design: PBFTNetwork}\label{subsec:strawman-design}

For simplicity we begin with a notarization protocol based on PBFT, then iteratively refine it into Spectrum.

PBFTNetwork assumes that a group of ${n = 3f + 1}$ trusted nodes has been pre-selected upfront and fixed and at most $f$ of these nodes are byzantine.
At any given time one of these nodes is the \emph{leader}, who observes events on connected blockchains,
batch them and initiate round of notarization within the consensus group.
Remaining members of the consensus group verify the proposed batches by checking the presence of updates on corresponding blockchains.
Upon successful verification each node signs the batch with its secret key and sends the signature to the leader.

Under simplifying assumptions that at most $f$ nodes are byzantine the PBFTNetwork guarantees livness and safety.
However, the assumption of a fixed trusted committee is not realistic for open decentralized systems.
Moreover, as PBFT consensus members authenticate each other via non-transferable symmetric-key MACs, each consensus
member has to communicate with others directly, what results in $O(n^2)$ communication complexity.
Quadratic communication complexity imposes a hard limit on scalability of the system.
Such a design also scales poorly in terms of adding support for more chains.
The workload of each validator grows linearly with each added chain.

In the subsequent sections we address these limitations in four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Opening consensus group and leaders.} We introduce a lottery-based mechanism for selecting consensus group and leaders dynamically.
    \item \textbf{Replacing MACs by Digital Signatures.} We replace MACs by digital signatures to make authentication transferable
    and thus opening the door for sparser communication patterns that can help to reduce the communication complexity.
    \item \textbf{Scalable Collective Signature Aggregation.} We utilize Byzantine-tolerant aggregation protocol that allows for
    quick aggregation of cryptographic signatures to reduce communication complexity to $O(\log n)$.
    \item \textbf{Eliminating Validator Bottleneck.} We shard consensus groups into units by the type of chain each node is able to handle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol Flow}\label{subsec:protocol-flow}

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping}\label{subsubsec:bootstrapping}

The system is bootstrapped in a trusted way.
A manually picked set of validators $V_0$ is assigned to the first epoch $e_0$.
On-chain vaults are initialized with an aggregated public key $aPK_0$ of the initial committee.
All initial committee members generate verification tuples ${(v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$
and agree on the genesis block.

\subsubsection{Normal Flow}\label{subsubsec:normal-flow}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Registration.
    All Spectrum stakeholders can register for becoming a committee member.
    To get a chance of becoming a member of $V_n$ in the epoch $e_n$ they register in a lottery during the $e_{n-2}$
    epoch by publishing their verification tuples ${(v_i^{vrf}, v_i^{kes}, v_i^{dsig})}$.
    \item Lottery.
    Once registration is done and epoch $e_{n-1}$ comes to the end, all registered participants evaluates
    ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$ locally and compare the generated random $y$ with their corresponding consensus threshold
    ${T_i^j}^*$ for this epoch.
    If successful, then publish $y$ and the associated proofs to form an approved consensus members table.
    \item Committee key aggregation.
    Once new committee is selected, nodes in $V_n$ aggregate their individual public keys $\{PK_i\}$ into
    a joint one $aPK_n$.
    \item Committee transition.
    Nodes in $V_{n-1}$ publish cross-chain message ${M_n : (aPK_n, \sigma_{n-1})}$ , where $aPK_n$ is
    an aggregated public key of the new committee $V_n$ , $\sigma_{n-1}$ is an aggregated signature of
    $M_n$ such that ${Verify(\sigma_{n-1}, aPK_{n-1}, Mn) = 1}$.
    Vaults are updated such that ${Vault\{(E_{n-1}, aPK_{n-1})\} \coloneqq (e_n, aPK_n)}$.
    \item Decentralized Asset Management (Custodial).
    Nodes in $V_n$ observe events on supported L1 chains, agree on the set of updates
    and compute state outbound state transitions accordingly.
    \item Notarisation (Non-custodial).
    Nodes in $V_n$ observe events on supported L1 chains.
    Committee leader batch an updates and batch is collectively notarized.
    All notarized batches are syncing and one of the committee leaders publish resulted block on-chain.
\end{enumerate}

\item The ${\mathcal_{F}}_{VRF}$ is designed in such a way that not every slot has a leader, moreover, most of the slots remain empty to serve protocol synchronization.
If there are $P$ several elected leaders for this slot, they all propose a new batches of updates $\{B_p\}_{p=0}^P$ with included proofs of the leadership ${(v_i^{vrf}, y, \pi)}$ and
${(\pi, \rho_\pi)}$.
